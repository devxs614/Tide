# Tide — AI development log

I'm Claude Code. The Tide team asked me to build their app for the North
American AI Challenge for Neurodiverse Learning 2026 from their product
specification (docs/TIDE_BUILD_PROMPT.md). The organizers allowed fully
AI-generated code, so I wrote the code, the tests and most of the
documentation. This log is my working journal: what I understood before
each part, what I built, what broke, what I decided and what's still open.
The team owns the product, the research and the pitch.

## What I understood before starting
2026-10-28, 23:18

Tide is for students like Maya: a 19-year-old first-year engineering student
with ADHD who doesn't fail at planning, she gets stuck at two moments, starting
a task and switching between activities, and her feelings decide whether she
can move. The product is one loop: name the feeling, adapt the plan, bridge
the transition, regulate, re-check, and learn what works for her. Every screen
I build has to feed or use that loop.

What matters most for the judges, as I read the spec: a live demo that cannot
fail (so every AI call has a deterministic fallback and the demo has cached
responses and its own clock), a pattern engine that is honest (k of n, n ≥ 3,
"Not true for me"), real accessibility (keyboard, reduced motion, text size,
Literal mode, read aloud), a safety layer that stops coaching on crisis
language, and a repository a student can explain line by line.

Rules I must not break: no accounts, no analytics, no server storage of user
text, no streaks or guilt, no red error states, no emojis in the UI, no
secrets in the repo, no invented facts or statistics in the app, and honest
attribution of everything I generate.

How I'll work: Phases 0 to 10 in order, each one with a "Before" entry here,
then build, run lint/typecheck/tests/build, walk the flow (tests, plus the
in-app browser where I can), fix, write the "After" entry, update the other
docs, commit and move on.

## Before Phase 0 — Foundation
2026-10-28, 23:18

This phase is invisible to Maya but everything she touches sits on it: the
calm colors and big readable type, the local database that keeps her data on
her phone, the clock that lets the demo pretend it's Thursday afternoon, and
the content lists (48 emotion words, 20 strategies, crisis resources).

It reads nothing and writes the foundations: tokens in globals.css, Dexie
tables, repo functions that every later phase writes through, a settings
provider, the copy catalog, and the app shell with four tabs and the
"Check in" button.

What "done" means for me: the app runs, the four tabs navigate, theme and
text size apply, Dexie opens, the tests for quadrant mapping, strategy
ranking and the clock pass, and the two guard tests (no `Date.now(` outside
clock.ts, no raw hex in components) pass. Every file gets a real header
comment.

What could go wrong: the installed versions are newer than what I know well.
Before writing this entry I scaffolded the project so I could read what was
actually installed: Next.js 16.4 (its bundled AGENTS.md warns that APIs have
changed), Tailwind 4 (CSS-first config, no tailwind.config file), zod 4,
Anthropic SDK 1.3, Vitest 5 and shadcn 4. I read the bundled Next docs for
route handlers, Cache Components and the removal of `next lint`, and the SDK
types for `messages.create`. I'll record every place where the spec assumed
an older API in DECISIONS.md.

## After Phase 0 — Foundation
2026-10-28, 23:37

**What I built**
- The Next.js 16 project with TypeScript strict, Tailwind 4, ESLint, Prettier
  and Vitest (jsdom + fake-indexeddb + Testing Library).
- Design tokens for light and dark mode, the four state colors and tints, the
  17px type scale driven by a `--text-scale` variable, an always-visible
  3px focus ring, and reduced-motion rules (`src/app/globals.css`).
- Domain types, the Dexie database, the demo-aware clock, date helpers and
  the quadrant mapping (`src/lib/*`).
- The repo layer (`src/lib/repo/*`) with the win rules from Section 8.3
  wired into task, focus, strategy and transition writes.
- The settings provider with the localStorage mirror, the inline first-paint
  script, and `useReducedMotionPref()`.
- All content: 48 emotions, 6 task types, 20 strategies with steps, crisis
  lines, and the copy catalog with Gentle/Direct/Literal variants.
- The app shell: PhoneFrame, TopBar with the menu and demo badge, TabBar,
  the Check in button opening an (empty) sheet, and every tab route.
- The strategy ranking from 9.4, the five prompt files, and the docs.

**How I checked it**
- lint ok, typecheck ok, 22 tests passing, build ok.
- Tests: quadrant mapping, average point, clock (real and demo), time
  formatting, strategy ranking (personal history, suppression after two
  "worse", the 4-week window, bridge length limit), repo side effects, and
  the two guard tests.
- In the in-app browser at 390×844: the shell renders in dark mode (system
  preference) and light mode, the Tasks tab is marked `aria-current`, the
  Check in button opens a focus-trapped sheet with a labeled Close, the
  `tide` IndexedDB database opens, and the root font size is 17px.

**What broke and how I fixed it**
- `averagePoint` turned Drained + Frustrated into Surge, because
  `Math.round(-0.5)` is `-0` and zero counts as high energy. The demo
  expects Ebb. I made `clampCoord` round half away from zero (D5).
- The generated shadcn Dialog and Sheet used a button size I removed for
  being under 48px. I rewrote both with a labeled "Close" button.
- `create-next-app` refuses a non-empty folder, so I scaffolded in a scratch
  directory and copied the files in, keeping the team's README line.

**Decisions**
- D1 Cache Components off. D2 `eslint .` instead of `next lint`. D3 Tailwind 4
  tokens in CSS. D4 demo start in local time. D5 rounding. D6 no red style.
  D7 no next-themes. D8 contact methods. D9 extra settings keys. D10 where
  win text lives.

**Known issues**
- The manifest and icons referenced in `layout.tsx` don't exist until
  Phase 8, so the browser logs two 404s in development.

**For the team**
- Added the initial TEAM_TODO list from Section 17.7, plus a note that I kept
  your README line at the top of the new README.

**Commit:** chore(base): set up the Tide foundation (hash recorded at the
start of Phase 1)
